    ); // The viewport size for the local browser
  });

  // This test covers login for the Applitools demo site, which is a dummy banking app.
  // The interactions use typical Playwright calls,
  // but the verifications use one-line snapshot calls with Applitools Eyes.

    // You will need to check the Applitools dashboard for visual results per checkpoint.
    // Note that "unresolved" and "failed" visual checkpoints will not cause the Playwright test to fail.

    // If you want the Playwright test to wait synchronously for all checkpoints to complete, then use `eyes.close()`.
    // If any checkpoints are unresolved or failed, then `eyes.close()` will make the Playwright test fail.
  });
